## My process ⚙️

### Built with 🛠️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Css preprocessor
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned 📚

This challenge allowed me to consolidate and expand my knowledge in javascript, especially in:
-Management of events.
-Functions of validation.
-Creation of regular expressions.
-Manipulation of the DOM.

In turn, this was the first project using SASS to style my html, getting into the use of:
-Nestings
-Partial
-Mixins
-Extends

### Continued development 🔨

In relation to sass, I want to consolidate the management of its syntax and the advantages it offers compared to simple css style sheets.
As for javascript, I want to address more challenges related to form validations, to finish learning how it works.
